These are the scripts. They run the compiled c programs in 
a specific order to collect a dataset. Though stringing programs 
together could be done in C, it's much faster and easier to
understand doing it in bash.

The staleScripts folder is where I put scripts that served a
purpose in collecting data at one time, but are no longer currently
being used. Before you start writing a new script, you should
consider looking in here to see if something has already been started.

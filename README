This code is used to assist in controlling and data aquisition
for the rubidium spin filter experiment at University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. A RaspberryPi is connected to a Measurement
computing DAQ device, the MCC 1208LS. Using the RaspberryPi
and the 1208LS, we can control the stepper motor, the
photomultiplier counter, and an analog controlled voltage supply. 

gnuplot is used for data visualization

system.cfg is a configuration file which stores variables
related to the system and records them in every data file 
recorded. system.cfg should be edited before each data 
run is performed. 

Analysis, or in general data that is collected and displayed in a file
on a single line, should be presented with all relevant experimental 
variables for easy data processing in the future.
